# Scalar Potential Landscape

## Overview

In the Waveframe v2.0 model, the scalar field \( \phi \) is not just a source of energy—it is the **clock** that defines cosmic time itself. Its evolution is governed by the structure of its potential \( V(\phi) \), which shapes how epochs arise, how time flows, and how expansion proceeds. This section examines candidate potentials and visualizes their implications.

## 1. Functional Forms Considered

We explore three representative forms for \( V(\phi) \), each capturing different theoretical intuitions:

### Cosine (Axion-like)
\[
V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right)\right]
\]
- **Periodic**, supports cyclic or quasi-cyclic behavior.
- Inspired by axion models and pseudo-Nambu–Goldstone bosons.
- Naturally bounded: \( 0 \leq V(\phi) \leq 2\Lambda^4 \)

### Quadratic (Massive Field)
\[
V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 \left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right)^2
\]
- Simple massive scalar field.
- Unbounded growth in potential.
- Lacks internal periodicity.

### Exponential (Runaway)
\[
V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 \exp\left(-\frac{\phi}{f}\right)
\]
- Used in quintessence and attractor models.
- Steep at small \( \phi \), shallow at large \( \phi \).
- Generates unidirectional flow of field value.

## 2. Visualization

The following figures illustrate the structure and dynamics induced by each potential.

### Scalar Potential Landscape

This plot shows the shape of \( V(\phi) \) across a range of \( \phi \in [-4\pi, +4\pi] \). The cosine potential creates wells and peaks—enabling the possibility of **cyclic behavior** as the field oscillates. The quadratic and exponential forms provide contrasting dynamics, showing smooth, unbounded growth or decay.

### Gradient of Potentials

![Potential Gradient](../figures/potential_gradient.png)

The gradient \( V'(\phi) \) determines the **force** acting on the scalar field. For the cosine form:
\[
V'(\phi) = \frac{\Lambda^4}{f} \sin\left(\frac{\phi}{f}\right)
\]
This produces alternating acceleration and deceleration zones, critical for shaping wave-like dynamics. By contrast, the quadratic and exponential gradients either grow linearly or decay rapidly, lacking the same rhythmic modulation.

## 3. Why Cosine?

The **cosine potential** is favored in Waveframe v2.0 because:
- It naturally supports **repeating epochs** as \( \phi \) evolves.
- Its bounded structure creates a **waveform-like energy landscape**.
- The sinusoidal gradient allows for **stable, oscillatory solutions** in φ, ideal for an emergent time framework.

This behavior aligns with our hypothesis that **cosmic time arises from scalar field dynamics within a cyclic potential landscape.**

## 4. Physical Parameters

We adopt natural units with \( M_{\text{Pl}} = 1 \). For visualization, we use:
- \( \Lambda = 0.5 \)
- \( f = 1.0 \)

These values yield realistic amplitudes for cosmic evolution while preserving the mathematical structure needed for waveform cycles.

---

## 5. Open Questions

- Can \( \Lambda \) and \( f \) be derived from deeper first principles? (e.g., information theory, holography, symmetry breaking)
- What happens to waveform stability when \( f \ll 1 \) or \( f \gg 1 \)?
- Could this potential be an **emergent structure** from entanglement entropy or a geometric action?

---

## 6. Next Steps

With the potential now formalized, we proceed to:
- Model the evolution of \( \phi(t) \)
- Connect φ’s oscillations to **expansion epochs** via the Friedmann and Hamiltonian constraints
- Quantify how scalar dynamics generate time-as-an-emergent variable
