# The Waveframe Hypothesis

An alternative cosmological model exploring emergent time, scalar field dynamics, and nonstandard expansion histories. This repository documents the theoretical formulation, numerical implementations, and observational comparisons of the Waveframe cosmology.

- `figures/` – All generated plots and their captions (`captions.md`)
- `data/` – Observational datasets and model output arrays
- `docs/` – Public-facing documentation and paper drafts (if applicable)

## What is Waveframe?

Waveframe proposes that cosmic time is not a fundamental dimension but an emergent property of a dynamical scalar field φ. Spacetime unfolds as the field evolves, governed by a potential V(φ) which shapes the expansion history of the universe. This contrasts with ΛCDM by:

- Rejecting a constant cosmological constant
- Embedding oscillatory or decaying field dynamics
- Exploring emergent or cyclic time scenarios
- Testing against real-world data: H(z), μ(z), fσ₈(z)

## Scientific Highlights

- Potentials tested: Cosine, Exponential, Inverse Power Law, Cutoff Hybrids  
- Metrics analyzed: Hubble parameter, distance modulus, structure growth
- Diagnostics: Reduced χ², AIC/BIC (where available), visual overlays with data
- Numerical integration: Friedmann + Klein-Gordon system with background terms (matter + radiation)

## What This Is / Isn’t

This is:
- A complete, falsifiable cosmological model
- A full-stack framework for scalar field testing
- A documented exploration of nonstandard expansion

This is not:
- A replacement for ΛCDM (yet)
- A polished model tuned to CMB or BAO constraints
- Backed by an institution, affiliation, or academic funding
