# Waveframe Hypothesis v2.0

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1030461404.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16696712)

A cosmological model where time, expansion, and gravity emerge from the oscillatory dynamics of a scalar field.  
Waveframe v2.0 marks a departure from traditional spacetime-driven cosmologies. This version treats the scalar field φ not merely as an evolving quantity, but as the very source of emergent cosmic time and structure.

# Overview

This model proposes that cosmic time is not a background parameter but an emergent phenomenon generated by the internal dynamics of a scalar wavefunction φ. As φ evolves, it defines an effective time coordinate that gives rise to expansion, structure formation, and gravitational phenomena. The Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric is no longer assumed, but instead arises from the behavior of φ as a natural consequence of its waveform dynamics.

## Theory

The core theoretical formulation of Waveframe v2.0, where φ defines emergent time and expansion arises from its internal dynamics, is documented here:

→ [Emergent Time Formalism](theory/emergent_time_formalism.md)

Key goals of v2.0:
- Develop a Lagrangian where φ defines the clock
- Reframe cosmological expansion as a derivative of φ’s internal phase space evolution
- Quantify how the scale factor, Hubble parameter, and structure growth follow from the emergent dynamics
- Compare model predictions against observational datasets (fσ₈(z), H(z), μ(z), BAO)
- Derive the Hamiltonian constraint and show how φ acts as a physical clock from first principles [see derivation](theory/hamilton_clock_derivation.md)

# Conceptual Shift from v0.2

Waveframe v0.2 utilized φ as a dynamical field within classical FRW cosmology, assuming time and spacetime geometry.  
Waveframe v2.0 redefines this structure:

| Feature | v0.2 | v2.0 |
|--------|------|------|
| Time | Assumed background | Emergent from φ |
| Metric | Input (FRW assumed) | Derived from φ evolution |
| Expansion | Dynamical scale factor | Phenomenon caused by φ waveform curvature |
| Interpretation | Modified quintessence model | Foundation for cyclic/emergent cosmology |
