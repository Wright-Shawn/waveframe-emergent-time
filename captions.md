# Figure Captions – Waveframe Hypothesis

## hz_with_matter_radiation.jpeg
**Expansion history H(z) in the Waveframe model with scalar field, matter, and radiation components.**  
The inclusion of standard matter (ρₘ ∝ a⁻³) and radiation (ρᵣ ∝ a⁻⁴) restores a physically valid early-time regime, allowing the scalar field to dominate only at late times. This plot confirms that H(z) evolves monotonically with redshift and behaves consistently with known expansion dynamics.

## fsigma8_overlay.jpeg
**Predicted vs. observed structure growth rate fσ₈(z) for the Waveframe model.**  
Waveframe’s prediction (solid line) is compared against redshift space distortion measurements from BOSS, eBOSS, and VIPERS (black points with error bars). The model exhibits severe undergrowth, indicating suppressed structure formation inconsistent with observational data.

## phi0_vs_mu_chi2.jpeg
**Reduced χ² for μ(z) (supernova distance modulus) as a function of initial scalar field value φ₀.**  
Only physically valid cosmologies (with d_L > 0 for all z) are shown. Flatness in the reduced χ² curve suggests minimal sensitivity of geometric fit to φ₀ within the viable range, indicating robustness of the background expansion.

## phi0_vs_chi2.jpeg
**Reduced χ² for fσ₈(z) as a function of initial scalar field value φ₀.**  
Large values across all φ₀ indicate persistent tension between the Waveframe model and observed structure growth. Fluctuations suggest φ₀ tuning can marginally improve fits, but no value fully resolves the mismatch.

## inverse_power_potential.jpeg
**Inverse power law scalar potential with α = 2.**  
The steep early decline and flat late-time tail give this potential strong early-time damping and late-time persistence. Despite its analytical simplicity, the field evolution under this potential failed to match large-scale structure growth without modifications.

## cosine_exp_potential.jpeg
**Cosine-modulated exponential scalar potential.**  
The combination of periodicity and exponential decay provides early-time control with a soft fade. Used in hybrid models to prevent runaway behavior in φ while retaining dynamical flexibility.

## fsigma8_tuned_waveframe.jpeg
**Tuned Waveframe prediction for fσ₈(z) with φ₀ = 2.0.**  
Even with favorable initial conditions, the model predicts negative growth—an unphysical result inconsistent with galaxy clustering measurements. Indicates that the scalar field fails to source structure formation under current configurations.
